#boolean

print(2 > 1) #true 2 is greater then 1
print(2 <= 1) #false 2 is not lower or equal then 1
print(2 != 1) #true 2 is not equal 1
print(2 == 2) #true 2 is equal 2

#logical

print(2 == 2 and 2 > 1) #true, 2 is equal to 2 and 2 greater then 1
print(2 == 2 or 2 < 1) #true, 2 is equal to 2 (cause OR operator needs only 1 true)
print(not 2 == 2) #false cause NOT operator gets the oposite of what expected (expected true)
