[IANN DIOR - CUTTHROAT]
[Lyrics]

I know, got a feeling that I might blow
Even though this industry is cutthroat
Now I don't feel the same
Think these drugs drive me insane
Cutthroat, swear these bitches, they be cutthroat
I'm so low
Cruising through the city with my eyes closed
'Cause I'm losing my brain
Gotta keep on moving straight
Over, when you say it's over I'm not sober
Loner, she left me so lonely with no closure
Now I don't feel the same
Think these drugs drive me insane

They want to see me live
And I cannot forgive
Think I'm really going psycho
Thinking that I might blow
And I can't let you in
Baby, I can't forgive
Got me hanging on a tight rope
It's time for me to let go, 'cause
These drugs got me thinking that I need you
But I don't really need you
It's hard for me to see through
But now I see the real you
Like glass, I see right through you
Now why you acting new new, we both know what you wanna do
Shorty in my phone
But where you at?
Run off with my love, like you was a running back
But now I got you running back (ayy, yeah)
Now I got you running back (ayy, yeah)

I know, got a feeling that I might blow
Even though this industry is cutthroat
Now I don't feel the same (oh no)
Think these drugs drive me insane
Cutthroat, swear these bitches, they be cutthroat
I'm so low (so low)
Cruising through the city with my eyes closed
'Cause I'm losing my brain
Gotta keep on moving straight
Over, when you say it's over I'm not sober
Loner, she left me so lonely with no closure
Now I don't feel the same
Think these drugs drive me insane

They know we them niggas
And that's why they hate us
Only worry 'bout the money
So no you can't phase us
I can't never fall in love 'cause love is full of danger
You were my other half and now you are a stranger
Now I'm hard to reach, hard to find
In my line, all the time, every night
We living in a trippy life, I'm sad inside
So I really don't care to fight, enjoy the high
And now you want back in
But I can't let you in
Now you get to watch where I go
Got you going psycho
And no we can't be friends
And we can't make amends
Now it's time for you to let go
I'm just someone that you used to know

I know, got a feeling that I might blow
Even though this industry is cutthroat
Now I don't feel the same (oh no)
Think these drugs drive me insane
Cutthroat, swear these bitches they be cutthroat
I'm so low (so low)
Cruising through the city with my eyes closed
'Cause I'm losing my brain
Gotta keep on moving straight
Over, when you say it's over, I'm not sober
Loner, she left me so lonely with no closure
Now I don't feel the same
Think these drugs drive me insane
